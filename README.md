Particle Photon Portable Humidity and Temperature Sensor - Particle Photon, DHT22, SparkFun Photon Battery Shield, Nokia 5110 Display

### What is this repository for? ###

This script allows to read data from a DHT22 (or other sensors supported by PietteTech_DHT library) using Particle Photon and publish retrieved data on the web and print it on serial.
The project works using a LiPo battery and does not need WiFi connection to show sensor data on the screen.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy the code contained into photon-portable-humidity-temperature-sensor.ino into Particle Build: https://build.particle.io/build/new
* Add the required libraries to your project searching them in "Libraries", in your Particle Build project
* Flash it to your Particle Photon
* Cackle into a dark cave
